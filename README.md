# highlights

i am a regular twitter user. the amount of high value content it has is [uncomparable](https://near.blog/how-to-twitter-successfully/). the profile highlights feature is really awesome, and being a broke ass i decide to make one myself. very minimalistic.

uses [`react-tweet`](react-tweet.vercel.app) with [`unstable_cache`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache) in nextjs to fetch the tweets.
